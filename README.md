# Full Meal Generator

Generates **one full meal** and one **alternative meal** without repeats containing:
- Appetizer
- Main course with side dish
- Dessert

Great for those days when you'd rather eightball your meals than gaze at the inscrutible depths of your cupboard. May generate slightly unhinged yet oddly tempting suggestions. 

Built in Javascript as a portfolio project for the Full Stack Dev career path at Codecademy.
